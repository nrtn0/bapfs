description: Getting started in Organized Play: character creation and more… all you need to get going. 
---

Paizo Organized Play is a roleplaying organization where you can play your character in any game anywhere in the world.  Scenarios and quests are designed to bring players together as they explore, investigate mysteries, and fight the forces of evil in a shared setting that responds to their decisions. It's a great way to make new friends!

### What do I Need to Start?
You only need two things, in this order of importance:

1. A good attitude
2. An Organized Play membership ID (you can get one at the [Paizo site](https://paizo.com/organizedplay/myAccount) or your GM can help you get one)

Really… that's all you need. You can walk into a game and play a pregenerated character, or build your own and bring all the bells and whistles! 

### What are These Games Even?

We play three main games: [Pathfinder Second Edition](https://paizo.com/pathfinder) is the newer one and is a high fantasy setting full of swords and sorcery. [Starfinder](https://paizo.com/starfinder) is the science fantasy and space opera side of things. Pathfinder First Edition is the game Paizo published for a decade; it still has a vibrant collecive of die-hard players in our area.  We have curated some quick links to learn more:
